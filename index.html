        <p>Welcome!</p>

        <p>I am a Makaton tutor and I have over ten years of experience of working with children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

        <p>Working with children and young people with special needs and disabilities is a passion of mine, not just a career. This professional passion became a personal one four years ago when my son was born with Cerebral Palsy. The start of my own little adventure.</p>

        <p>My son's Cerebral Palsy has mainly affected his verbal motor function and thanks to Makaton he is able to express his extensive vocabulary and understanding wonderfully. He is the reason I am a Makaton tutor today.</p>

        <p>I want to ensure everyone has access to this incredible language programme that empowers those with special needs and disabilities to achieve their potential!</p>

        <p>If you would like to start your Makaton journey with me please get in touch.</p>

        <p>Within my current role for <a href="https://resourcesforautism.org.uk/">Resources for Autism</a>, I support parents and children by providing advice, training and advocacy. Prior to this, I worked as an Inclusion Officer across three inner city London schools. I worked extensively with children who had a variety of needs such as Autism, ADHD, Cerebral Palsy, chromosomal imbalances and medical needs. I was responsible for implementing EHCPs, instilling inclusive teaching practices and training staff and parents. Within my work I am able to utilise my psychology background to inform my practise and recommend research based strategies.</p>
